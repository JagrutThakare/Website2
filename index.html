                        Algebra is the branch of mathematics that studies algebraic operations[a] and algebraic
                        structures.[2] An algebraic structure is a non-empty set of mathematical objects, such as the
                        real numbers, together algebraic operations defined on that set, such as addition and
                        multiplication.[3] Algebra explores the laws, general characteristics, and types of algebraic
                        structures. Within certain algebraic structures, it studies the use of variables in equations
                        and how to manipulate these equations.[4][b]

                        Algebra is often understood as a generalization of arithmetic.[8] Arithmetic studies arithmetic
                        operations, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, in a specific domain of
                        numbers, like the real numbers.[9] Elementary algebra constitutes the first level of
                        abstraction. Like arithmetic, it restricts itself to specific types of numbers and operations.
                        It generalizes these operations by allowing indefinite quantities in the form of variables in
                        addition to numbers.[10] A higher level of abstraction is achieved in abstract algebra, which is
                        not limited to a specific domain and studies different classes of algebraic structures, like
                        groups and rings. These algebraic structures are not restricted to typical arithmetic operations
                        and cover other binary operations besides them.[11] Universal algebra is still more abstract in
                        that it is not limited to binary operations and not interested in specific classes of algebraic
                        structures but investigates the characteristics of algebraic structures in general.

                        abstraction. Like arithmetic, it restricts itself to specific types of numbers and operations.
                        It generalizes these operations by allowing indefinite quantities in the form of variables in
                        addition to numbers.[10] A higher level of abstraction is achieved in abstract algebra, which is
                        not limited to a specific domain and studies different classes of algebraic structures, like
                        groups and rings. These algebraic structures are not restricted to typical arithmetic operations
                        and cover other binary operations besides them.[11] Universal algebra is still more abstract in
                        that it is not limited to binary operations and not interested in specific classes of algebraic
                        structures but investigates the characteristics of algebraic structures in general.
